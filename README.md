# Leetcode solutions

## For a better experience

To make it more smooth when solving problems I create some scripts to be used by CLI.

to run, maybe you will need to run

```bash
chmod +x leet.js
```

```bash
npm link
```

for create a new folder for your solution with the test file up you should

```bash
leet sol <name> <numberOfTestCases>
```
